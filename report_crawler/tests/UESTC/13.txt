Abstract：
The concepts of object class (i.e. entity type), relationship type, and attribute of object class and relationship type are the three basic concepts in the Entity Relationship Model. We call them ORA-semantics. In this talk, we first show that the schema languages of relational model and XML data model cannot capture the ORA-semantics that exist in the ER Model. However programmers must know the ORA-semantics of the database in order to write SQL and XQuery programs correctly. Without using ORA-semantics in database, the quality of some database research areas is poor in correctness and completeness. In this talk, we then show how ORA-semantics can be used to improve the quality significantly in some database areas such as schema integration, and XML and RDB keyword search.
In schema integration, entity resolution is widely studied.  However, we must also consider relationship resolution. We also need to differentiate between primary key vs object identifier, local vs global object identifier, and local vs global functional dependency, etc. All these concepts are related to ORA-semantics and they have big impact on the quality of the integrated schema.
Existing XML keyword search approaches such as LCA, SLCA, etc. are all LCA-based and structure-based searches; they rely on the structural features but not the hidden ORA-semantics in data-centric XML document. Existing RDB keyword search approaches are all based on foreign key-key reference and minimal connected subgraph that contains all the query keywords. We identify the serious limitations of existing XML and RDB keyword search approaches such as meaningless answer, missing answer, schema dependent answer, etc. We exploit the ORA-semantics in XML data and RDB to improve the correctness and completeness of XML and RDB keyword search by detecting duplications of objects and relationships. Etc.
